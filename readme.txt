## Boost Your Revenue with WowRevenue Campaigns

**Normal Discount:** Create discount offers for specific products and display them on other product and cart pages. So, with this campaign, you can upsell, cross-sell, and down-sell your desired items.

**Frequently Bought Together:** It is an advanced and effective way to cross-selling. You can recommend essential and related items for the main products using this campaign. So, the shoppers can purchase all or some of the products together as a bundle and get a discount.

WowRevenue helps you create amazing offers and empowers you to control placement. The rest is up to you, explore the following opportunities and make the best use of them.


**WooCommerce Pages:** While creating a discount campaign, you can choose the page on which you want to display it.

**Pop-Up:** You can also showcase special offers in pop-up. It ensures that potential buyers see it and encourages them to grab it.

**Floating:** Displaying the offers in a sticky floating bar would increase engagement and ensure all visitors see offers.
